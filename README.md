# iCloud Video Cleanup

Apple does not provide a way to sort Photos by size (on purpose, so you pay for more iCloud storage), this script allows you to highlight videos that are > 30 seconds long, so you can easily reclaim some space.

*Dear Apple, please let us sort our iCloud library by File Size / See what files are taking the most space.*



## Usage

- [Install TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), and then install [icloudcleanup.js](icloudcleanup.js) as a user script.

- Go to https://www.icloud.com/photos/ and then Media Types -> Videos
